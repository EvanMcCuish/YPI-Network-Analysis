Once the Pathways data are downloaded from ICPSR, several steps are necessary to set-up the data. 

First, there is an assumption of equidistant measurement periods. Although the Pathways data include 10 measurement intervals,
the YPI was not part of the baseline assessment and the first few waves had 6-month intervals. We therefore included ONLY the
12-month, 24-month, 36-month, 48-month, 60-month, 72-month, and 84-month measurement periods, which corresponds to six time intervals.

Second, The 12, 24, and 36-month follow-up periods only looked at counts of criminal behavior in the previous six months (the others
looked at counts of criminal behavior in the last 12 months). Criminal behavior at the 12, 24, and 36-month follow-up periods was
therefore measured by combining offending at the wave of interest with the wave immediately prior (e.g., the 12 month period 
includes criminal behavior involvement reported in that wave as well as criminal behavior reported in the 6-month wave).
If a specific item from the SRO was endorsed at both waves, it was counted only once given that the emphasis was on criminal versatility.

Third, we converted the SPSS dataset from wide to long format (see SPSS Syntax file). Note that we re-named variables from how they 
were worded in the original dataset for clarity. 

Fourth, we imported the SPSS dataset into R Studio and ran the missForest package to impute missing data on the YPI subscales and
measure of offending versatility. This can be found in the "PPD L Net (Subscales)" file.

Fifth, we ran the code for the network analysis that produced the between-subjects, temporal, and contemporaneous networks.
This can be found in the "PPD L Net (Subscales)" file.

Additional R code has been included that repeats the abovementioned analyses but with the YPI's three domains rather than 10 subscales.
As well, code for the bootnet analysis is also included. This shows the reliability of the centrality indices.
